TODO:
- chown files to bearer token username (*) or predefined user name (configurable)
    - /home/shybyte/IdeaProjects/go-remote-storage/bin/main -storage /var/www/owncloud/data -mode owncloud -port 8888 -chown www-data -resources /home/shybyte/IdeaProjects/go-remote-storage/src
    - apply while creating nested paths
- compare with other implementations (owncloud, example-server, 5apps) especially for versioning stuff
- test with https apache reverse proxy
- add speed tests, test speed on raspberry pi
- deb package
    - base
    - home folder service
    - own cloud service
- support multiple If-None-Match, If-Match, http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html

Ideas:
    - Support several password hash functions? sha3? Is sha512 really secure?
    - Create user dir on first request (ask for password)

Done:
- configure path and port
- create test data dir
- test should restore test data dir in temporary folder
- finished directory listing
- load data
- save data
    - mark ancestor folders as modified
- handle content type (save in hidden files)
    - ignore hidden files for directory listings
- delete data
    - remove ancestor dirs if empty
- handle version stuff (412 codes)
- read/write permissions handled correctly
- scopes permissions handled correctly
- public special handling
    - read access without bearer token (but no directory listing!)
    - read/write/delete access with bearer token
- think about security (breaking out the storage dir)
- change password hash to sha512
- make storage folder structure configurable in order to allow using home folder and owncloud storage
- option to configure resources (templates,css)
